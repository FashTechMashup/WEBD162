     <h2>A Perfect Ending...</h2>
     <p>
       The weekend of May 10th, 2019 I went to Chicago to see a BTS concert with my
       best friend. The trip was planned months in advance but it wasn't until a
       few weeks before that one of my favorite fashion tech designers, Behnaz Farahi
       announced that her latest creation would be displayed at the Museum of
       Science and Technology which, you guessed it, resides in Chicago, IL! I was
       stoked by the coincidence and immediately added the exhibit she would be
       displaying her work in, Wired to Wear, to the itenary. It was such a great
       experience that I want to share it with you. Explore the site to learn more
       about four of my favorite pieces from Wired to Wear.
