     <h2>The Marlene Dress by Lisa Lang</h2>
     <p>
       I’ve always been a sucker for bright and sparkly things and this dress
       has both with its LEDs and Swarovski crystals. A combination of 3D printing,
       laser cutting, and traditional fashion methods brought this dress to life.
       It’s hard to see from the picture but it looked like the crystals
       themselves were glowing. My favorite part of this dress though is the
       inspiration. The designer Lisa Lang was inspired to make this dress after
       finding letters by an actress named Marlene Dietrich who, “wrote of her
       desire for a dress that glowed softly and left people wondering if they
       had imagined seeing light.”
