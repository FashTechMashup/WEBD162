 <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>
 <p>
   “Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at
   your side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink
   into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your
    side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed
    legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you
    have in life. Namaste.”
