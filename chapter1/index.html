Hello World!

<p> My favorite coffee drink right now is a Lavender Honey Lattee from
  Communal Coffee in North Park. <br> I love this drink because it has the
  perfect amount of sweetness and floral aromas. <br> I almost always get it hot
  along with their delicious avocado toast. <br> When I opt for a cold drink
  it's usually their Lavender Lemonade. Apparently I have the lavender bug.
